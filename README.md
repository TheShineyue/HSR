Because the code needs time to sort out, the code file has not been uploaded for the time being.

## ðŸ”” News

- \[2025.05.16\]. Our work is accepted by ACL 2025 (Findings)!

## Environment Preparation

```python
conda create --name hsr python=3.9
conda activate hsr
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Preparation

We use the [VLGuard](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ys-zong/VLGuard) dataset to complete the identification of safety-critical attention heads and safety-critical neurons, and download the train subset to the "data_process" folder.
