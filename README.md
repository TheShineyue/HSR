Because the code needs time to sort out, the code file has not been uploaded for the time being.

## ðŸ”” News

- \[2025.05.16\]. Our work is accepted by ACL 2025 (Findings)!

## Quick Start

We use [llava-next-llama3-8b-hf](https://modelscope.cn/models/llava-hf/llama3-llava-next-8b-hf) as an example to show the workflow of hsr.

### Environment Preparation

```python
conda create --name hsr python=3.9
conda activate hsr
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset Preparation

We utilize the [VLGuard](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ys-zong/VLGuard) to identify safety-critical attention heads and neurons. The training subset is downloaded into the "data_process" folder.

Next, we execute the get_data.py script, which generates two files: train_safe_safes.json and train_unsafes.json. These files serve as the utility and safety datasets, respectively.

### HSR

#### Step 1

In the SafetyHeadAttribution-hsr folder, modify the model path, data path, and other relevant settings in run.py, then execute the script. By default, the files containing the Ships scores for each head will be saved in the SafetyHeadAttribution-hsr/exp_res/llama3-llava directory (we have included the results from our run).
